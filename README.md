# Learning from Noisy Labels with Deep Neural Networks

**Read the _Learning from Noisy Labels with Deep Neural
Networks: combining sample selection and a robust loss function.pdf_ document.**

Most of the code used here was taken from:
* Code for ICML2020 Paper ["Normalized Loss Functions for Deep Learning with Noisy Labels"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13554)
* Code for ICCV2019 Paper ["O2U-Net: A Simple Noisy Label Detection Approach for Deep Neural Networks"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9008796)
* Code for NeurIPS'18 Paper ["Co-teaching: Robust Training of Deep Neural Networks with Extremely Noisy Labels"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06872)


The `XP_dnn_noisy_labels.ipynb` file contains the steps to run the code.
